# Herbarium Challenge 2019 - FGVC6

The FGVC 2019 Herbarium Challenge challenge is to identify melastome species from herbarium specimens provided by the [New York Botanical Gardens](https://www.nybg.org/plant-research-and-conservation/) (NYBG). We have provided a curated dataset of over 46,000 herbarium specimens for over 680 species of the flowering plant family Melastomataceae.

## Background
There are more than 400,000 known plant species with an estimated 80,000 still to be discovered. In flowering plants, it takes approximately 35 years from plant collection to species description while less than 16% of new species are described in less than 5 years. It has also been suggested that ‘herbaria are a major frontier for species’ with more than 50% of unknown species already in herbarium collections.

The family Melastomataceae, also known as the princess flower family, has more than 5,000 named species. Many of its species have extraordinary flowers. However, botanists make many of the species determinations from pressed herbarium specimens. We have 46,469 herbarium specimens that represent 685 melastome species. In addition, some species are represented by more than a hundred specimens, while others are represented by 20 specimens.

The teams with the most accurate models will be contacted, with the intention of using them on the un-named melastome collections in the NYBG herbarium collection, and assessed by the NYBG melastome specialist.
